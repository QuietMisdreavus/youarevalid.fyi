# you are valid, fyi

this was a website sketch i did back in 2017 in an attempt to add more positivity to the world.
there's not much to it, just some CSS animations i found from the internet and a small paragraph
that loads in a short phrase at a time. the intent is to make the site be calming while it provides
its message. i like to link it periodically on twitter to give some hope to my followers.
